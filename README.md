# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber_Ride_Share_Analysis
##Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to explore ridshare data using python and pandas databases in order to provide visualizations to better highlight rideshare services. Pyber is a ridshare service company that provides services to several different types of cities. This assignment showcases the affordability, as well as market demand for rideshare services amongst different cities with varying demographics. Pyber ultimately wants to better understand the affordability of these areas based on demand for services

###RESULTS:

The results of the analysis are fairly interesting. The 3 city types demonstrate different average fares, a vast difference in the number of drivers, and the total fares for each city in a given period of time. Starting with the city type, we can see that the as the city becomes more dense from rural to urban, the total number of rides increases. Similarly, The amount of drivers also increase to meet the demand for services. We can also see that as the demand for services increases, the total fare naturally increases but the average fare per ride decreases. This is likely based on the number of drivers available. The supply of drivers in rural areas drives up the average fare price, and fare per driver. Rural areas have less drivers and are likely driving longer distances to transport their customers to their desired locations. Based on this the price for service is higher wheres Urban locations are relatively dense, with more accesss to drivers making the price for services cheaper.

###SUMMARY:

The disparities among the three city types are fairly obvious. To summarize, we see less drivers in rural areas, more in urban areas. The price per ride is higher in rural areas and less in urban areas and the fare per driver is higher in rural areas. The implications for these findings can suggest several options based on the goals of Pyber. If the goal is to maximize profit while ensuring greater affordability for the taret customers, Pyber would need to provide more drivers in rural areas. More market research would be necessary however in order to understand the demand for services. Based on the data, the total number of rides in rural areas was 125 compared to 1,625 in urban areas. This could simply reflect the population density which we dont have access to based on the datasets. We can infer that rural areas are less populated, have less demand for driver services, and thus there are less drivers. I would first recommend more marketing research into addressing the disparity of drivers and rides. The lower count in total rides in rural areas needs to be further explored in order to establish more insight into customer needs. Recommending more drivers in a rural population might lower the average cost per ride, but might not result in more revenue for Pyber if the dmenad for services isnt. Based on the current data we could input a larger driver count based on the demand from month to month which would likely increase the number of rides and thus total fare, with a lower cost in fares per driver. This would make customers more satisfied while still earning revenue for the company. We could plot a dataframe that explores total driver count based on month or week to show the relationship of availability of drivers based on peaks in weekly demand relative to the total rides and cost. This would show the CEO where Pyber is falling short in each city type area of providing adequate drivers to meet the demand for rides
